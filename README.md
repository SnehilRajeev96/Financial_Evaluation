Agentverse AI-Powered Financial Analysis System
This repository contains a modular, agent-based system designed to automate strategic financial analysis and valuation estimation for public companies. It leverages a multi-agent architecture, powered by scraping, calculations, and rule-based scoring â€” all orchestrated by a centralized Coordinator Agent.
 Use Case: AI-powered revenue multiple estimation for companies like Apple, based on financial, market, innovation, competitive, and ESG signals.
Core Agents & Roles
1.	FinancialDataAgent
Extracts key financial metrics from company websites or databases. It parses revenue, profit, cash flow, employee count, and client concentration data to calculate:
o	Revenue Growth Rate
o	EBITDA Margin
o	Net Profit Margin
o	Revenue per Employee
o	Client Concentration Risk (how dependent the company is on top clients)
This agent quantifies the company's operational efficiency and profitability.
2.	MarketIntelligenceAgent
Gathers market data including the companyâ€™s revenue, total addressable market (TAM), and competitive environment. It compares the companyâ€™s growth with that of competitors and evaluates:
o	Global Market Share
o	Growth Advantage vs Competitors
o	Regional Revenue Growth
o	Industry Diversification (presence in multiple sectors)
This agent helps measure market positioning and growth sustainability.
3.	InnovationIPAgent
Assesses how innovative the company is by analyzing patents, R&D spending, and the proportion of revenue coming from intellectual property (IP)-based products. It evaluates:
o	Number of Patents (and how they compare to industry average)
o	R&D Spend as % of Revenue
o	Productization Level (how well R&D translates into revenue)
This agent captures the companyâ€™s ability to create defensible innovation.
4.	ESGComplianceAgent
Scrapes ESG ratings, diversity statistics, and regulatory badges like ISO, GDPR, or HIPAA. It evaluates the companyâ€™s ethical and governance posture using:
o	ESG Rating (from third-party sources like MSCI or Sustainalytics)
o	DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) Representation
o	Number of Compliance Certifications Achieved
This agent helps assess investor risk from a sustainability and governance perspective.
5.	USPsCompetitiveEdgeAgent
Measures the companyâ€™s unique strengths and brand defensibility. It collects data on specialized revenue streams, strategic partnerships, and customer satisfaction. Key outputs:
o	Niche Capability % (share of revenue from specialized technologies)
o	Number of Strategic Partnerships
o	Net Promoter Score (NPS) to gauge customer loyalty
This agent maps differentiation and customer trust into tangible metrics.
6.	CalculationScoringAgent
Takes all outputs from the above agents and assigns a weighted score (1 to 5 scale) to each category based on predefined benchmarks. It then computes:
o	Weighted Performance Score
o	Estimated Revenue Multiple (6x to 16x range based on total score)
This agent converts diverse company signals into a single, comparable valuation metric.
 How It Works
Step 1: CoordinatorAgent calls each of the 5 specialized agents
Step 2: Each agent scrapes or ingests company data and computes metrics
Step 3: Results are passed to CalculationScoringAgent
Step 4: A final weighted score is computed and mapped to a revenue multiple
Step 5: Output is served as a structured JSON â€” ready for dashboard visualization
